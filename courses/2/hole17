Everyone should know the game minesweeper, so given a matrix of bombs and safe spaces print back the corresponding values for each location. A 0 stands for no bomb and a 1 stands for a bomb.
Example 1: 
	Input:  0 1 0
	        1 0 1
		0 1 0
		1 0 1

	Output: 2 2 2
		2 4 2
		3 4 3
		1 3 1

Example 2:
	Input:  0 0 0
	        1 1 1

	Output: 2 3 2
		1 2 1

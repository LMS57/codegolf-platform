Elcomeway otay ethay inalfay olehay inyay isthay oursecay. Welcome to the final hole in this course. I can't say that I am surprised but this one is weird. Given a string convert the string to pig latin. Here are the rules:
	1. Words beginning with consonants, take all the consonants before the first value, move them to the end of the word, and add 'ay'. latin -> atinlay
	2. If a word begins in a vowel, y included, add 'yay' to the end. example -> exampleyay

Example: 
	Input: convert this sentence to latin of the pigs
	Output: onvertcay isthay entencesay otay atinlay ofyay ethay igspay
